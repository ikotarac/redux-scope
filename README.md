# Redux Scope ðŸ”­

Reduce Redux boilerplate and improve modularity.

Redux scope logically brings together _actions_, _action types_, _reducers_ and _selectors_.
It puts the focus on **reducers** and the **state**, making them modular and well organised, sparing you from writing boilerplate and doing all the wiring manually.

## Installation

`npm install redux-scope`

## Usage

```javascript
import createScope from 'redux-scope';
import { fetchUserDataAsync } from './my-user-api';

const userProfileScope = createScope('user-profile-scope');
const { createAction, connectReducer } = userProfileScope;

// creates a thunk with corresponding request, success and error actions
const fetchUser = createAction(fetchUserDataAsync, 'fetch-user');

// creates a simple action creator and its type
const setFontSize = createAction('set-font-size');

const userDefault = {
  user: null,
  loading: false,
  error: null,
};

function user(state = userDefault, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    // value: 'user-profile-scope/fetch-user/request'
    case fetchUser.type.request:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: true,
        error: null,
      };
    // 'user-profile-scope/fetch-user/success'
    case fetchUser.type.success:
      return {
        ...state,
        user: action.payload,
        loading: false,
        error: null,
      };
    // 'user-profile-scope/fetch-user/error'
    case fetchUser.type.error:
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        error: action.error,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// when you connect reducer, you get selectors based on the shape of the default state
const { user, loading, error } = connectReducer(user);

// you can connect more reducers to a single scope
function preferences(state = { fontSize: 'small' }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    // simple actions have type 'user-profile-scope/set-font-size'
    case setFontSize.type:
      return {
        ...state,
        fontSize: action.payload,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const { fontSize } = connectReducer(preferences);
```

You can now export your action creators and selectors and use them as usual:

```javascript
dispatch(setFontSize('large'));
const size = fontSize(state); // 'large'
```

### Getting root reducer

When you're ready to create your redux store, just use the root scope to get the root reducer

```javascript
// import createStore, ...
import { createRootReducer } from 'redux-scope';
import { userProfileScope } from './user-profile';

const rootReducer = createRootReducer(userProfileScope);
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

### Remarks

âœ¨ Generated root reducer produces state with the following shape

```json
{
  "user": {
    "user": null,
    "error": null,
    "loading": false
  },
  "preferences": {
    "fontSize": "small"
  }
}
```

âœ¨ All selectors are wired automatically, they recieve root state and work everywhere

```javascript
loading(state); // false
fontSize(state); // 'small'
```

## Composing scopes

Redux scopes can be nested. Let's make another scope:

```javascript
export const favoritesScope = createScope("favorites-scope");
const { createAction, connectReducer } = favoritesScope;

const addToFavorites = createAction("add-to-favorites");

function favorites(state = [1, 2], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case addToFavorites.type:
      return [...state, action.payload],
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const getFavorites = connectReducer(favoriteProfiles);
```

Now let's connect `favorites` scope as a child of the `user-profile` scope, and create root reducer.

```javascript
// import createStore, ...
import { createRootReducer } from 'redux-scope';
import { userProfileScope } from './user-profile';
import { favoritesScope } from './favorites';

userProfileScope.connectScope(favoritesScope);

const rootReducer = createRootReducer(userProfileScope);
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

Now, generated state looks like this:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "user": null,
    "error": null,
    "loading": false
  },
  "preferences": {
    "fontSize": "small"
  },
  "favorites-scope": {
    "favorites": [1, 2]
  }
}
```

âœ¨ All reducers in a child scope are combined together using `combineReducers` before being merged with reducers that belong to the parent scope

âœ¨ This combined reducer is named after the scope it belongs to, in this case `favorites-scope`

### Scopes can be nested in any arrangement

We can do the nesting the other way around, `favoritesScope.connectScope(userProfileScope)`, or we can create a new scope just to contain all the child scopes:

```javascript
const appScope = createScope('app-scope');
appScope.connectScope(userProfileScope);
appScope.connectScope(favoritesScope);

const rootReducer = createRootReducer(appScope);
```

This would produce:

```json
{
  "user-profile-scope": {
    "user": {
      "user": null,
      "error": null,
      "loading": false
    },
    "preferences": {
      "fontSize": "small"
    }
  },
  "favorites-scope": {
    "favorites": [1, 2]
  }
}
```

If you pass a collection of scopes to `createRootReducer`, it will create the root scope for you behind the scenes:

```
const rootReducer = createRootReducer([
  userProfileScope,
  favoritesScope
]);
```

### Action types are scoped automatically

Nesting scopes automatically prefixes action types with scope names of all the parent scopes. Say, if we dispatch following actions:

```javascript
dispatch(addToFavorites(12345));
dispatch(setFontSize('large'));
dispatch(fetchUser());
```

created actions would have automatically scoped action types:

```
'app-scope/favorites-scope/add-to-favorites'
```

```
'app-scope/user-profile-scope/set-font-size'
```

```
'app-scope/user-profile-scope/fetch-user/request'
'app-scope/user-profile-scope/fetch-user/success'
'app-scope/user-profile-scope/fetch-user/error'
```

### Selectors stay wired correctly

âœ¨ No matter where you import and use your selectors, you always pass the root state, no need to pass the substate selector manually.

âœ¨ The mechanism of nesting scopes using `connectScope` makes sure all selectors remain connected to the right part of the state. Neat! ðŸ”¬

âœ¨ Your modules do not need to know where their reducer will be mounted, thus you get enhanced modularity.

âœ¨ You can use your selectors like any other selector, compose them or use them with [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect).

## Interop with other reducers

### Connecting external reducer to Redux scope

Just connect your reducer to a scope:

```javascript
import { reducer } from './external-module';

const externalScope = createReducer('some-external-module');
externalScope.connectReducer(reducer);
```

### Connecting result of `createRootReducer` to external reducer

Provide a path to the mounting point so that selectors can work correctly

```javascript
// use redux scope as usual
const myRootScope = createScope('my-root-scope');

// provide path to root scope so that selectors can work correctly
const myRootReducer = createRootReducer(
  myRootScope,
  state => state.somewhere.deep,
);

// use like any other reducer
const otherReducer = combineReducers({
  myRootReducer,
  // ... other reducers
});
```
